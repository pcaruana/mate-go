// purposes, not to really design API around. Methods are really just functions.

	// Taking a look at the function again: "func (d data) displayName()", that receiver is the
	// parameter because it is truly a parameter. It is the first parameter to a function that call
	// displayName.
	// Similar to d.setAge(45). Go is calling a function that based on the pointer receiver and
	// passing data to its parameters. We are adjusting to make the call by taking the address of d.
