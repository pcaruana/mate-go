# Encapsulation

In Object oriented programming, we are used to public, private, protected type of access
mechanism. Go is different. Everything in Go is about package.

Package is a self-contained unit of code. Every folder in our source tree is a self-contained
user code. We will get deeper into that in package oriented design section. For now, if we are
thinking about a package being that self-containing code, firewall that separates code and
having language supported for it then we can think of encapsulation being associated with the
package itself.

The idea is: anything that is named in a given package can be exported or accessible through
other packages or unexported or not accessible through other packages.
