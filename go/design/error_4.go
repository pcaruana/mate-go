			// what important. We can switch here, from type as context to type as behavior if we
			// do this type assertion and only ask about the potential behavior of that concrete
			// type itself.

// Lesson:
// Thank to Go Implicit Conversion.
// We can maintain a level of decopling by creating an interface with methods or behaviors that we only want,
// and use it instead of concrete type for type assertion switch.
