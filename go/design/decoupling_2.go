// -------------------------
// Decoupling With Interface
// -------------------------

// By looking at the API (functions), we need to decouple the API from the concrete implementation. The decoupling
// that we do must get all the way down into initialization. To do this right, the only piece of
// code that we need to change is initialization. Everything else should be able to act on the
// behavior that these types are gonna provide.

// pull is based on the concrete. It only knows how to work on Xenia. However, if we are able to
// decouple pull to use any system that know how to pull data, we can get the highest level of
// decoupling. Since the algorithm we have is already efficient, we don't need to add another level
// of generalization and destroy the work we did in the concrete. Same thing with store.

// It is nice to work from the concrete up. When we do this, not only we are solving problem
// efficiently and reducing technical debt but the contracts, they come to us. We already know what
// the contract is for pulling/storing data. We already validate that and this is what we need.

// Let's just decouple these 2 functions and add 2 interfaces. The Puller interface knows how to
// pull and the Storer knows how to store.
// Xenia already implemented the Puller interface and Pillar already implemented the Storer
// interface. Now we can come into pull/store, decouple this function from the concrete.
// Instead of passing Xenial and Pillar, we pass in the Puller and Storer. The algorithm doesn't
// change. All we doing is now calling pull/store indirectly through the interface value.

// Next step:
// ----------
// Copy also doesn't have to change because Xenia/Pillar already implemented the interfaces.
// However, we are not done because Copy is still bounded to the concrete. Copy can only work with
// pointer of type system. We need to decouple Copy so we can have a decoupled system that knows
// how to pull and store. We will do it in the next file.
