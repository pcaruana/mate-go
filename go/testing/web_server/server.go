// Web server
// ----------

// If we write our own web server, we would like to test it as well without manually having to
// stand up a server. The Go standard library also supports this. Below is our simple web server.

package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	// Import handler package that has a set of routes that we are gonna work with.
	"github.com/pcaruana/work-mate-go/go/testing/web_server/handlers"
)

func main() {
	handlers.Routes()

	log.Println("listener : Started : Listening on: http://localhost:4000")
	http.ListenAndServe(":4000", nil)
}
