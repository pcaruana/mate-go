// ----------------
// Read/Write Mutex

// There are times when we have a shared resource where we want many Goroutines reading it.
// Occasionally, one Goroutine can come in and make change to the resource. When that happens, everybody 
// has to stop reading. It doesn't make sense to synchronize reads in this type of scenario
// because we are just adding latency to our software for no reason.

// Lesson:
// -------
// The atomic functions and mutexes create latency in our software. Latency can be good when we
// have to coordinate orchestrating. However, if we can reduce latency using Read/Write Mutex, life
// is better.

// If we are using mutex, make sure that we get in and out of mutex as fast as possible. Do
// not anything extra. Sometimes just reading the shared state into a local variable is all we need
// to do. The less operation we can perform on the mutex, the better. We then reduce the latency to
// the bare minimum.
