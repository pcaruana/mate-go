// Mutexes
// -------

// We don't always have the luxury of using of 4-8 bytes of memory as a shared data. This is where
// the muxtex comes in. Mutex allows us to have the API like the WaitGroup (Add, Done and Wait)
// where any Goroutine can execute one at a time.

var (
	// counter is a variable incremented by all Goroutines.
	counter int

	// mutex is used to define a critical section of code.
	// Picture mutex as a room where all Goroutines have to go through. However, only one Goroutine
	// can go at a time. The scheduler will decide who can get in and which one is next. We cannot
	// determine what the scheduler is gonna do. Hopefully, it is gonna be fair. Just because one
	// Goroutine got to the door before another, it doesn't mean that Goroutine will get to the end first. Nothing
	// here is predictable.

	// The key here is, once a Goroutine is allowed in, it must report that it's out.
	// All the Goroutines come in will ask for a lock and unlock when it leave for other one to get
	// in.

	// Two different functions can use the same mutex which means only one Goroutine can execute
	// any of given functions at a time.
